## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The project is meant to be build via `CMake` and `Make`. You should also have a C
compiler (whether it be GCC or CLANG).

### Documentation Prerequisites

The documentation is made thanks to `doxygen`, so you must have it installed on
your machine.

See [here](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html) to install
`doxygen`.

## Installing

### Building from source

Follow the instructions below to build the library.

```
git clone 
cd 
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make
```

### Binaries

There are no binaries released currently.

### Packages

There are no packages available so far.

## Running the tests

No test are yet implemented.

## Building the doc

The doc is generated by doxygen, so you should have it installed.

```
doxygen Doxyfile
``` 

It creates a `doc` folder containing both `html` and `latex` version of the
documentation.

- To open the documentation in the browser, open the `doc/html/index.html` file.

- To open the pdf version :

```
cd doc/latex
make
```

The pdf is called `refman.pdf`.
