## Building the doc

The doc is generated by doxygen, so you should have it installed.

``` 

It creates a `doc` folder containing both `html` and `latex` version of the
documentation.

- To open the documentation in the browser, open the `doc/html/index.html` file.

- To open the pdf version :

```
cd doc/latex
make
```

The pdf is called `refman.pdf`.
